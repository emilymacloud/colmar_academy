# Colmar Academy Project

This is the Capstone Project for the Codecademy Skill Path: Learn How to Build Websites (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites). This Project involved designing and creating the landing page for a new school. I was given wireframes and made decisions about colour and typography.
